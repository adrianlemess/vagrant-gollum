# Gollum

This Vagrant image has [Gollum](https://github.com/rubyworks/jekyll-gollum/blob/master/README.md)   installed and is intended to be a quick way to see if Gollum is a useful tool without installing all of the Ruby packages locally.


## To Use:
You will need to have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.  Once installed: 

	1. Create or clone your git-enabled wiki inside this repo
	2. `cd` into that directory
	3. Type `vagrant up`

With your browser, go to `http://localhost:4567` to your wiki via Gollum.
